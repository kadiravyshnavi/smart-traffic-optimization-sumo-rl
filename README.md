# 🚦 Smart Traffic Signal Optimization using Reinforcement Learning (DQN + SUMO)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an intelligent traffic signal control system using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** and **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**.

The system learns adaptive signal policies to **minimize vehicle waiting time** and **reduce congestion**, outperforming traditional fixed and greedy methods.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timing cycles, which leads to:

* Traffic congestion 🚗
* Increased waiting time ⏳
* Inefficient road utilization

---

## 💡 Solution

We use:

* **SUMO** → realistic traffic simulation
* **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** → adaptive signal control
* **Evaluation framework** → compares RL with baseline strategies
